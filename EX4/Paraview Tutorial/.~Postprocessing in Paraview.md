# Postprocessing in Paraview

Paraview is a powerful postprocessing tool. We shall explore how to handle the VTK files generated in EX 4. 

## Installation

- Go to the following link: https://www.paraview.org/download/
- Download the `ParaView-5.8.0-Windows-Python3.7-msvc2015-64bit.exe` file 
- Launch the executable and perform the standard installation (No need to uncheck anything)
- Paraview takes approximately 1.1GB. 



## Fixing the VTK files

The VTK files that are generated by `FiPy` have a bug and need to be modified which can be done quickly with a short python script or a one-line command in linux. The python script `fix_vtk.py` is in the EX4 folder. Dont worry about the details of the script if you arent interested. Just run the following command at the end of the simulation

```bash
python fix_vtk.py
```

If you are using Linux / WSL, you can use the following line of code which is arguably more elegant: 

```bash
sed -i "s/^41$/9/" *.vtk
```



## Opening the VTK Files and doing basic visualization

Paraview is quite smart and does not require the user to manually open every single VTK file. It can recognize patterns in the file name and generate a series. 

Click `File` and then `Open`:

![Paraview_openfile](C:\Users\CE-KPI15\Projects\pde-Solver-Course\EX4\Paraview Tutorial\Paraview_openfile.png)

You are able to observe that in the folder, Paraview has lumped all the VTK files into one group. You just need to load that single file into the software. 

![Paraview_loadseries](C:\Users\CE-KPI15\Projects\pde-Solver-Course\EX4\Paraview Tutorial\Paraview_loadseries.png)

If you observe the parts of the user interface circled in red, you will see that the file has been successfully loaded.

Click the eye icon to see the data: 

![Paraview_4](C:\Users\CE-KPI15\Projects\pde-Solver-Course\EX4\Paraview Tutorial\Paraview_4.png)

The data we see is the chemical potential $\mu_{AB}$ at $\tilde{t}=0$. To change the view to the composition field, click on the button listed on the next  screenshot and select the $a$ field: 

![Paraview_5](C:\Users\CE-KPI15\Projects\pde-Solver-Course\EX4\Paraview Tutorial\Paraview_5.png)

If you observe point 1, you can see that there is a box icon next to `$a$` sign on the list of fields. This indicates that the data is the cell data. This explains why the the image looks so pixelated. The next point 2 shows the range of the colour bar. $a(t=0)$ has an average of $0.77$ and a range of $\pm 0.03$ which is as indicated in the simulation step-up. 

Next we need to smooth out how the data looks. This requires applying a `Cell Data to Point Data` filter. To do this, we first need to click the apply button on the properties panel. We could also apply a different colour scheme which requires us to click the button in point 1: 

![Paraview_6](C:\Users\CE-KPI15\Projects\pde-Solver-Course\EX4\Paraview Tutorial\Paraview_6.png)

The list of various presets available can be found here. We shall select the`Jet` preset and apply it. There are more available: 

![Paraview_7](C:\Users\CE-KPI15\Projects\pde-Solver-Course\EX4\Paraview Tutorial\Paraview_7.png)

We can see the impact of selecting the new colour scheme and clicking `Apply` in the previous image : 

![Paraview_8](C:\Users\CE-KPI15\Projects\pde-Solver-Course\EX4\Paraview Tutorial\Paraview_8.png)

We can now apply the `Cell Data to Point Data` Filter. First highlight the `0_output.vtk*` in the `Pipeline Browser` by clicking it once, then click `Filters` -> `Alphabetical` -> `Cell Data to Point Data`:

![Paraview_9](C:\Users\CE-KPI15\Projects\pde-Solver-Course\EX4\Paraview Tutorial\Paraview_9.png)

We can see a new item in the pipeline browser which shows us the previously applied filter: 

![Paraview_10](C:\Users\CE-KPI15\Projects\pde-Solver-Course\EX4\Paraview Tutorial\Paraview_10.png)

We then re-select the $a$ field and see how the smoothened field looks like: 

![Paraview_11](C:\Users\CE-KPI15\Projects\pde-Solver-Course\EX4\Paraview Tutorial\Paraview_11.png)

We can now rescale the data so that the color bar reflects the full range of the mole fraction i.e. $a \in [0,1]$: 

![Paraview_12](C:\Users\CE-KPI15\Projects\pde-Solver-Course\EX4\Paraview Tutorial\Paraview_12.png)

Click `Rescale and disable automatic rescaling` and we can see how the data looks when its rescaled. Note how the color bar reflects the updated scaling: 

![Paraview_13](C:\Users\CE-KPI15\Projects\pde-Solver-Course\EX4\Paraview Tutorial\Paraview_13.png)

We can now view the how the field evolves. All we need to do is to click the play button. Let us see the results at the final timestep. 

![Paraview_14](C:\Users\CE-KPI15\Projects\pde-Solver-Course\EX4\Paraview Tutorial\Paraview_14.png)

We can see how the the demixing occurred and small spherical particles appeared. 



## Creating a 1D plot 

Suppose we want to extract a 1D plot of the $a$ across a line. That can be done in Paraview quite easily. 

We first highlight the data in the pipeline browser which in this `0_putput.vtk*` and
