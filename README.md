# Introduction

We present an introductory course on using `FiPy`, a PDE solver in python. It is hoped that the exercises in the module will expose the user to both the syntax needed to solve a problem of interest and also certain mathematical and numerical features that provide insight on general issues related to numerically solving PDEs. 

The course is aimed at people who have a basic understanding of PDEs and vector calculus such as 2nd year students and above. Extensive notes are provided for each exercise. Basic notes on how to set-up a python environment on Windows and using Paraview for post-processing is also available. 

The `Figures` directory contains files needed to generate the various plots and figures found in the notes. It is a bit messy, but you can ignore it.
