# Introduction

We present an introductory course on using `FiPy`, a PDE solver in python. It is hoped that the exercises in the module will expose the user to both the syntax needed to solve a problem of interest and also certain mathematical and numerical features that provide insight on general issues related to numerically solving PDEs. 

There are a variety of PDE solvers native to python out there: 
- FiPy
- Fenics
- Dedalus
...

The exercises developed in this course can be readily implemented in the other solvers for comparision. That is the goal for the next step of this course. 

The course is aimed at people who have a basic understanding of PDEs and vector calculus such as 2nd year students and above. Extensive notes are provided for each exercise. Basic notes on how to set-up a python environment on Windows and how to use Paraview for post-processing are also available.
